      Colour palettes & Dark Mode
    </h3>

    <h4 id="colours">Colours</h4>
    <p>
      Personally I think canopy is already using the best colour palette you could ever want but I understand it may
      not fit your needs. Through the use of the :root selector in css, you can override almost every colour in the
      library (current colours are based on <cpy-link href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors" new-tab>tailwind</cpy-link>).
      Below is the simplest example of overriding colours (replacing primary colour on light and dark mode):
    </p>
    <cpy-code-block id="colours-override-simple" language="scss"></cpy-code-block>
    <p>Some colours (mainly background colours) are set as rgb values
      without the rgb() container, since they are often manipulated within components to modify their opacity.</p>
    <p>A full list of the configurable colours is below (along with
      their defaulted values):</p>
    <cpy-code-block id="colours-palette-css" language="scss"></cpy-code-block>

    <h4 id="dark-mode">Dark Mode</h4>
      <p>
        By default, Canopy looks for a dark class on the HTML tag to determine if the colour palette should switch to
        dark mode, however this is easily configurable for your needs. Similarly to the main colour palette, you can
        override any dark mode colours:
      </p>
      <cpy-code-block id="colours-pallette-dark-css" language="scss"></cpy-code-block>
      <p>
        If you want to use a different method to checking for a dark class on the HTML tag, you can include your own css
        to set the colour variables. For example, if you want to use dark mode when the user has requested it in their
        browser settings, replace the html wrapper for your variables with:
      </p>
      <cpy-code-block id="colours-pallette-dark-alt" language="scss"></cpy-code-block>
    </div>
  </cpy-page-content>
