  <p>
    Canopy provides the necessary implementations to work with angular forms in a way developers will find familiar. Both <cpy-link href="https://angular.io/guide/forms" new-tab>template forms</cpy-link> and <cpy-link href="https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms" new-tab>reactive forms</cpy-link> are supported, but if you'd prefer to bind to the built in inputs and outputs on the form component manually then that is equally possible. Let's dive into some examples.
  </p>

  <h4 id="getting-started">Basic Usage</h4>
  <p>
    Using the form components natively as defined by the web component itself, you can easily set up a working input that easily keeps track of the current value in a form:
  </p>
  <cpy-code-example id="basic-usage-code" language="html" header="Basic Usage Example">
    <cpy-input id="basic-usage-example" label="Basic usage"></cpy-input>
    <br/>
    Tracked value of form: <span id="basic-usage-value"></span>
  </cpy-code-example>

  <h4 id="template-forms">Template Forms</h4>
  <p>
    Angular's template forms allow for 2-way data binding for the value of a form element. Canopy form components support template forms using a generated directive included in the angular build of the library.
  </p>
  <p>
    To get started, ensure you have the forms module imported where you will be using the component:
  </p>
  <cpy-code-block id="template-form-module" language="typescript"></cpy-code-block>
  <p>
    Then simply use the form component with angular's form functions to get the component working with 2-way data binding:
  </p>
  <cpy-code-block id="template-form-code" language="typescript">
  </cpy-code-block>

  <h4 id="reactive-forms">Reactive Forms</h4>
  <p>
    Angular's reactive forms provide a model-driven approach to handling form inputs whose values change over time. Canopy form components support reactive forms using a generated directive included in the angular build of the library.
  </p>
  <p>
    To get started, ensure you have the forms and reactive forms modules imported where you will be using the component:
  </p>
  <cpy-code-block id="reactive-form-module" language="typescript"></cpy-code-block>
  <p>
    Then simply use the form component with angular's form functions to get the component working with reactive form controls:
  </p>
  <cpy-code-block id="reactive-form-code" language="typescript">
  </cpy-code-block>
</cpy-page-content>
