  <h4 id="colors">Colors</h4>
  <p>
    Colors play an essential role in the design and user experience of a web application. They can evoke emotions,
    convey information, and enhance the overall look and feel of the interface. Choosing the right color palette is
    crucial for creating a visually appealing and effective design that meets the needs of your users.

  <p>
    Through the use of the :root selector in css, you can override any color at a root level within Canopy (current colors are based on <cpy-link href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors"
      new-tab>tailwind</cpy-link>).
    Below is the simplest example of overriding colors (replacing primary color on light and dark mode):
  </p>
  <cpy-code-block id="colors-override-simple" language="scss"></cpy-code-block>
  <p>Colors and other styles can also be overridden at a component level, by setting the relevant css variables on the component tag:</p>
  <cpy-code-example header="Component with style overridden" show-code>
<cpy-link style="--cpy-link-color: violet;">
  link<cpy-icon>launch</cpy-icon>
</cpy-link>
  </cpy-code-example>
  <p>A full list of the configurable colors is below (along with
    their defaulted values):</p>
  <cpy-code-block id="colors-palette-css" language="scss"></cpy-code-block>

  <h4 id="dark-mode">Dark Mode</h4>
  <p>
    By default, Canopy looks for a dark class on the HTML tag to determine if the color palette should switch to
    dark mode, however this is easily configurable for your needs. Similarly to the main color palette, you can
    override any dark mode colors:
  </p>
  <cpy-code-block id="colors-pallette-dark-css" language="scss"></cpy-code-block>
  <p>
    If you want to use a different method to checking for a dark class on the HTML tag, you can include your own css
    to set the color variables. For example, if you want to use dark mode when the user has requested it in their
    browser settings, replace the html wrapper for your variables with:
  </p>
  <cpy-code-block id="colors-pallette-dark-alt" language="scss"></cpy-code-block>
  </div>
</cpy-page-content>
