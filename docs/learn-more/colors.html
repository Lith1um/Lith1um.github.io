      Color palettes & Dark Mode
    </h3>

    <h4 id="colors">Colors</h4>
    <p>
      Personally I think canopy is already using the best color palette you could ever want but I understand it may
      not fit your needs. Through the use of the :root selector in css, you can override almost every color in the
      library (current colors are based on <cpy-link href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors" new-tab>tailwind</cpy-link>).
      Below is the simplest example of overriding colors (replacing primary color on light and dark mode):
    </p>
    <cpy-code-block id="colors-override-simple" language="scss"></cpy-code-block>
    <p>Some colors (mainly background colors) are set as rgb values
      without the rgb() container, since they are often manipulated within components to modify their opacity.</p>
    <p>A full list of the configurable colors is below (along with
      their defaulted values):</p>
    <cpy-code-block id="colors-palette-css" language="scss"></cpy-code-block>

    <h4 id="dark-mode">Dark Mode</h4>
      <p>
        By default, Canopy looks for a dark class on the HTML tag to determine if the color palette should switch to
        dark mode, however this is easily configurable for your needs. Similarly to the main color palette, you can
        override any dark mode colors:
      </p>
      <cpy-code-block id="colors-pallette-dark-css" language="scss"></cpy-code-block>
      <p>
        If you want to use a different method to checking for a dark class on the HTML tag, you can include your own css
        to set the color variables. For example, if you want to use dark mode when the user has requested it in their
        browser settings, replace the html wrapper for your variables with:
      </p>
      <cpy-code-block id="colors-pallette-dark-alt" language="scss"></cpy-code-block>
    </div>
  </cpy-page-content>
</cpy-page-container>
